The actual Sokoban level files were created by David W.Skinner - See
his site at http://users.bentonrea.com/~sasquatch/sokoban/

Since I'm bad at drawing, I took quite a lot of ready made graphics
from around the web: 
Some of the game images are from the Desktop KSokoban game - See
http://hem.passagen.se/awl/ksokoban/

The graphics for the movement buttons is from
http://www.silvestre.com.ar/?p=5. Many more are available there.
